*The opcode subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack*

## TASK 7: `div`

*The opcode divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack*

## TASK 8: `mul`

*The opcode multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack.*

## TASK 9: `mod`

*The opcode computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.*
